# freelance-hrs-tracker
A tracker application for the hours I work whilst freelancing as a clinical software developer.

# Features

- Just focus on 3 inputs: time started working, time finished working, and the length of any breaks. Everything else is automagically calculated!
- User authentication and authorization
